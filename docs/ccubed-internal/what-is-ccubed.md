# 💡 | What is CCubed?

## Our Purpose
The Computing Councils of Canada (also known as C³, or “CCubed”) is an officially registered national not-for-profit organization made up of student leaders in computer science from all over the country. We strive to create and foster an inclusive community for all students in computing-related fields across Canada. Our main goals are to improve inter-school collaboration between computing student organizations, to provide a support network, and to connect students nationwide through our events and initiatives.

## Our Structure

### The Executive Branch

**Directors**

These are the members who sit on our board of directors and are responsible for overseeing all parts of C³, both internal and external. Most lead a sub-team made up of several staff members who work together to accomplish their department’s goals.

**Staff Members**

Staff members contribute to the goals that are completed within each of our departments. Overseen by a director, these dedicated individuals provide their expertise and experience to bring our goals to life and make our mission values a reality.


### The Representative Branch
The Representatives are members who represent their institution’s constituency (students at their school studying in a computing-related field) in team-wide discussions and meetings. Representatives are typically the Vice-President Externals of their institution’s computing student association as they are already in a position dedicated to representing their students as the main point of contact to other external organizations, but exceptions are made on a case-by-case basis.
