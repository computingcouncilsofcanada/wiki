# Meet the Professionals: Industry Edition

**Contributed by: Wilfrid Laurier University (Laurier Computing Society)**

## Event Description

Meet the Professionals is an event that Laurier has been running for several years and it has been a great success every time! We run various editions of this event to target specific types of professionals such as recruiters or just general industry people. For industry edition, we gather people that work in various subfields of computing to have a panel discussion, answer questions from students, and network with them to help them make connections in the industry.

## Resources Required

### Food

The amount of food you will need largely depends on your projected attendance and the time of day you plan to host your event. If you plan the event around a traditional meal time be prepared to spend more money on food since people will be substantially more hungry. We recommend doing this event in the evening, after dinner, to keep food expenses lower as well as making it more comfortable for people to move around during the networking portion of the event.

### Speakers

Try to get a good variety of backgrounds from your speakers to ensure a lot of unique contribution from each member of the panel and to get the most impact for students. Examples would be cybersecurity, data science, UX design, software engineering, devops, and so many more! See CCubed’s company directory if you need assistance getting speakers lined up:

It is much easier to get speakers if you offer to pay for, or subsidize, their travel as people in the industry tend to be very busy and they are doing you a favour by attending the event. Also consider providing a small thank you gift (around $25) to show your appreciation for their assistance.

### AV Equipment

We always source our AV equipment from Long & McQuade because they offer decent pricing and can even help with setup if you are willing to pay for their services. For the panel discussion section of the event we recommend having 1-2 microphones depending on the number of speakers you have and getting the speakers to pass the mics amongst themselves when answering questions. When taking live questions from the audience, try to have one or two live mics set up with mic stands. Finally, make sure to get an audio mixer to control the levels of various mics throughout the event.

**************************************Note: If you are having some professionals join you virtually take into account the equipment needed to stream their audio and video to the crowd and to have a computer set up with them on a conference call for the networking portion.**************************************

## Extra Tips

We recommend doing this event in a large open space like an atrium to allow ease of movement during the networking portion of the event. Be sure to have a seating area as well so your attendees don’t get uncomfortable with standing during the panel discussion.

Make sure to have your tables for each professional in attendance appropriately spaced out to reduce crowding. 

Encourage people to visit and talk with each person so that everyone in attendance gets a chance to talk to someone they are really interested in.
